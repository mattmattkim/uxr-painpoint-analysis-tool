This folder contains sample interview transcripts that demonstrate the types of pain points commonly found in SOW (Statement of Work) processes.

## Files

- `sample-transcript-1.txt` - Project Manager perspective on SOW challenges
- `sample-transcript-2.txt` - Independent Consultant's experience with SOW creation

## Usage

These transcripts can be uploaded to the Pain Point Analysis Tool to see how the AI extracts and categorizes pain points. They cover common issues across all lifecycle stages:

1. Vague requirements gathering
2. Stakeholder alignment challenges  
3. Lack of standardized templates
4. Complex review processes
5. Difficult client presentations
6. Challenging negotiations
7. Manual signature collection
8. Poor handoff documentation
9. Inadequate change tracking
10. Limited retrospective data

## Creating Your Own Transcripts

When preparing interview transcripts for analysis:

- Use a clear format with speaker labels
- Include specific pain points and challenges
- Mention which lifecycle stage is being discussed
- Include severity indicators (words like "nightmare", "major bottleneck", "huge problem")
- Keep the conversation natural but focused on SOW processes

The AI will automatically identify and extract pain points, categorize them by lifecycle stage, and assign appropriate severity levels.
